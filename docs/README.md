# Documentation Index

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the DocRag project - an AI-powered technical documentation assistant built with Flask, ChromaDB, and OpenAI.

## Project Overview

DocRag is a production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) web application that answers questions from official technical documentation (React, Python, FastAPI). It features a Flask backend with ChromaDB for vector storage, OpenAI for embeddings and generation, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and includes rate limiting and chat history functionality.
