- **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with latest technologies and practices

## Getting Started

When working on the DocRag project:

1. **Identify the Domain**: Determine which agent's expertise is most relevant
2. **Review Agent Profile**: Read the specific agent's documentation for detailed knowledge
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Understand how different domains interact
4. **Apply Best Practices**: Follow the guidelines and patterns each agent recommends

## Project Context

The DocRag project is a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that combines:
- **Web crawling** for documentation ingestion
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic search
- **AI-powered responses** using OpenAI's GPT models
- **Real-time chat interface** for user interactions
- **Scalable deployment** on Railway platform

Each agent contributes to making this system robust, secure, performant, and maintainable.
